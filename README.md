# Hi, I'm Amro Alsharafi 👋

I'm a **Data Science / Software Engineering** student who builds practical projects in **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and **Web Development**.  
I care about: **clean code, reproducible results, and turning ideas into working systems**.

## 🚀 Featured Work (Start Here)
Here are the projects I recommend checking first:

- **100 Days of Python (100 Projects)** → `100-days-of-python`  
  A structured collection of 100 Python projects (beginner → advanced), covering automation, web, APIs, scraping, data science, and GUI apps.
- **Cybersecurity Risk Assessment (ML)** → `Predictive-Modeling-for-Cybersecurity-Risk-Assessment-and-Prioritization`  
  ML classifiers + feature engineering for vulnerability prioritization (CVE/CWE mapping).
- **E-commerce Customer Prediction / Analytics (ML)** → `E-commerce-Customer-spending-and-satisfaction-level-prediction`
- **Social Media Engagement (Supervised ML)** → `Social-Media-Engagement-Analysis`
- **Portfolio Website** → `amro-shiek-portfolio`
- **Mobile / App Project** → `eCommerce-Mobile-App` (Flutter/Dart)

*(Pinned projects are the best way to show recruiters what matters most.)*

## 🏆 100 Days of Code (Python Bootcamp)
I completed **100 projects** as part of the Udemy course:  
**“100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp”**  
Most project ideas come from the course structure, and I implemented them to build strong hands-on fundamentals.

✅ Topics covered include:
- Python foundations, OOP, error handling
- Automation + scripting
- APIs + authentication
- Web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
- GUI apps (Tkinter)
- Data science workflows (pandas, NumPy, visualisation)
- Flask web apps, databases, deployment basics

Repo: **`100-days-of-python`**

## 📌 What I’m working on now
- Building more portfolio-grade projects (ML + Web Apps)
- Improving documentation + code quality across repositories
- Preparing for internships / junior roles
